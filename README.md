## Overview
Probabi-List-ic Purchases facilitates the organisation of the best past-time â€” shopping for cheapies made out of Chineseum

## Technologies
The app is a single-page application that uses Angular for the front-end, NestJS for the back-end, and MySQL for the local database server

## Setup

To clone and run this application, you'll need Git and Node.js installed on your computer (or just download it from the repo). From the command line:

```bash
# Clone this repository
$ git clone https://github.com/GabrielAndreiPreda/wishlist-app

# Install dependencies
$ npm install
```

Npm can be used to run the application with the following command that starts both the front-end and back-end at the same time
```bash
npm start
```
For debugging the front-end and back-end can be served separately
```bash
nx wish-list:serve
nx api:serve
```

The local MySQL database has to be on the default port (3306) and the username & password have to be both '```root```' to work out of the box.

These settings can be changed in the NestJS ```app.module``` file (```wishlist-app\apps\api\src\app.module.ts```)
